In the second phase, the project will consider using agri-residue feedstocks such as mustard husk, castor and cotton-stalks which will be validated against Isometric's Biomass Protocol.

By diverting biomass from decay and combustion, the project locks carbon away for the long term while improving soils, reducing emissions, and supporting rural livelihoods. Every step of the process is digitally monitored and independently verified, ensuring full transparency.

The project takes its name from the historic region of Sanchore in western Rajasthan - once known as Satyapura, or the “city of truth.” In this spirit, it draws on ancestral wisdom and nature-based practices that honor the soil, the community, and the climate. By converting waste biomass into biochar, Satyapura restores degraded land, enriches soil organic carbon, and uplifts rural communities.
